Disstrictly
---------

Disstrictly is a hyperlocal, multi-medial and highly disruptive online-game for Berlin Hipsters. In a playful way we test how good you really know your neighborhood by showing you Eyeem-photos and SoundCloud-sounds recorded in your neighborhood vs. those from other areas of the city. If you guess which ones were taken in your hood, you are the ultimate Berlin-Pro. Show us how much of a local you really are.
