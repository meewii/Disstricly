Disstrictly
---------

Disstrictly is a hyperlocal, multi-medial and highly disruptive online-game for Berlin Hipsters. In a playful way we test how good you really know your neighborhood by showing you eyeem-photos and soundcloud-sounds recorded in your neighborhood vs. those from other areas of the city. If you guess which ones were taken in your hood, you are the ultimate Berlin-Pro. Show us how much of a local you really are.

Disstrictly was created in 24 hours during the Berlin Geekettes Hackathon in October 2013, in collaboration with @sweetdakini
